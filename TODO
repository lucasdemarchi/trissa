MILESTONE for version 1.0:

- camera only above ground ->> all the games have this problem... marking it
  temporarily as "won't fix"

- Put some effects in the end of the game when "selecting" the balls
- It's possible (and easy) to win against Minmax. Let it better.

Plans for 1.1:
- Port to windows / MacOS X

Plans for 1.5:
- Audio: music and effects
- Network: create a "Proxy Player" which will forward the request of the
  position to play to another machine, enabling to play through internet
